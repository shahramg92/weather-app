# Current Weather Conditions
Current weather conditions is an app that was developed using Python3, Tornado(back end), Jinja2(templates), Peewee(ORM) and Boto3(AWS). It uses the OpenWeatherMap to get the different weather conditions for the city you input. It also uses the IpInfo API which allows users to get weather conditions based on the ip address that they are using.
